Name: PHIL 334 Credits: 3 Desciption: Relationship between sex, gender, and philosophy. Topics may include ethics, epistemology, science, social relations, law, and personhood. Philosophers have had a problematic relationship with the sexual aspects of humanity, both the division of humanity along the lines of a male/female dichotomy, as well as the categories and practices involved in sexual activity. Issues of sex and gender are of significant ethical importance because of the significant disparities visible across history in the social positions of men and women, and because of the centrality of sexual and family norms in the reproduction of moral norms more generally. This course will provide a window on these subjects by looking at how some recent philosophers (as well as a few classic ones) have thought about sex and gender, with a special focus on contemporary feminism and the problem of sexual harassment.

Critics of the very idea of feminist philosophy of science insist that, because feminism is an explicitly political stance, it can have nothing to do with science or how we understand it philosophically. What distinguishes scientific knowledge and inquiry is its ability to transcend partisan, political interests and the relativism that threatens if these are allowed a role in science. So what can a "feminist" philosophy of science come to?

Name: ARTH 543B Credits: 3 Desciption: Photography in an Age of Surveillance and Violence: Susan Sontag has argued that images of violence pander to voyeurism, but do nothing to change the conditions that produce the suffering. Judith Butler has argued otherwise, making a case for the ability of photographs to alter social conditions. Among the questions the course will ask are: What strategies have been deployed by photographers, photo-based artists, filmmakers and video artists to intervene in a surveillant and globalized image-world? How should different spectator positions be understood in such an image-world?
Name: ARTH 550 Credits: 3 Desciption: This topical seminar on the Mediterranean (medieval and early modern) focuses on the tension between flow as uncontrolled, multidirectional, and unpredictable movement; and progression as structured, linear, and predetermined movement. As Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell underline in The Corrupting Sea, political domination in the Mediterranean was never about controlling the ports and the cities. Instead, it was about structuring and managing networks and movements. We will explore this idea on two interrelated levels: how the tension between flow and progression operates within artistic/architectural practices, and how it helps us to situate those practices within their social and political contexts.
