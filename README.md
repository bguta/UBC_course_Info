# UBC course_Info
a tool to quickly check the course information

# Usage
works as of Python 3.6.3 Dec 2017.

Instructions:

Install Python, if you haven't already (Mac OS already comes with Python pre-installed). You need to have installed the BeautifulSoup4 and requests libraries which you can install using the commands 'pip install requests' and 'pip install bs4' on the command line.

On Github, click on the green button that says "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP".

Extract the zipped/compressed folder and open the resulting folder.

Run course_info.py

# Remark
course_info.py reads the course info from a txt file called dict which has last been updated as of dec 2017. You may run dictionary_maker.py to update dict whenever the info becomes dated, be sure to wait for it to finish as it takes some time to make the dict.
